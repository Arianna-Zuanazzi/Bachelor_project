# Bachelor_project

This repository contains the work for my Bachelor thesis project. The work was conducted in R, using the Seurat toolkit. 

The purpose of this thesis project is to compare four different data integration methodologies. The datasets used contain the gene expression profiles from different breast cancer samples, characterized by varying degrees of severity and metastasis. A panel of statistical and computational metrics was implemented, in order to provide an objective evaluation of the various qualitative aspects of integration. Additionally, a function was developed whose purpose is to comprehensively benchmark the integration procedure and provide useful visualizations.
